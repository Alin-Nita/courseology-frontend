To solidify the concepts I’ve covered in Java, Spring, MySQL, & React I'm going to build a
full-stack web application which combines these technologies. The application needs to be able
to CRUD a particular database and will be based on a course and students structure.

Steps
#1 - Build a new react frontend
#2 – Generate a Java Backend for your Frontend
#3 – Create a page for showing each individual course/product/review
#4 – Create a page for people to add their courses

Specifications

Setup

- Make a folder called “full-stack-project”
- Inside I should have 2 sub folders/apps
- a React app
- a SprintBoot app

Safety

- I am fine to commit my week in the beginning, however remember that once I get
  onto my database connection I need to abstract out my password(s) into a file that
  isn't git tracked
- Think of my data structure first, think....
- What should a student/user have (name, email, interestedIn etc)
- What should a course have(name, category, completionTime, price, syllabus,
  author etc)
  -Use something like MURAL to plan out my structure
